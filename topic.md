# Iwakuni Bridge
### My favorite place to go and visit!!
> Iwakuni has a lot of places to go and explore, but my favorite place to go and look around is Iwakuni Bridge. The reason why i say this is because there are alot of festivals that go on around this area. The main one is the Cherry Blossoms festival. This is a very beautiful scene. I took my wife there for our first date. Everytime we go there we remember this is the place we fell in love.

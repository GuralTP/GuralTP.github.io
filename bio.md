# Hello my name is Tyler Gural  
> This is my first website I have ever made. I am making this website for my UMUC class IFSM 201. I am currently living in Iwakuni, Japan. I have been living in Japan for 5 years. Even though this is not where i am origionally from i do love this place. Japan is full of amazing culture and experinces. The very best thing about Japan is everyone here is honest. I met my wife out here also. We have 1 daughter right now named Scarlet, and a second one coming soon! Japan has really opened my eyes. If I can tell anyone to do somthing it would be to come experince Japan.
